# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mitch 

So, I'm Mitch Hijlkema and I'm a Front-end Software Engineer. I work with modern Angular and TypeScript professionally, and am experienced using the PHP Framework Laravel and CMS WordPress.

Besides Angular I know my way around Vue.JS, React and Custom Web Components. By using these tools I aim to create snappy accessible software with a robust environment to handle it.

At the moment I work at a DHL company: HillebrandGori. Here my focus is on external tooling for end customers in global alcohol freight where we function as a forwarder. This is made with a team of experienced Software Engineers so our customer always gets an innovating product in the Global Freight Forwarding world!

Besides this I dabble in Shopify consultancy to create storefront extensions using custom shopify apps for both basic and plus stores. To make this easier I'm working on a set of Web Components that offer a general framework using web native features named Zet.
