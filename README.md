# Hi there 👋 I'm Mitch 

So, I'm Mitch Hylkema and I'm a Web Developer. I prefer to work with PHP frameworks like WordPress and Laravel. And do not shy away from creating Front-End solutions using modern tooling. Including, but not limiting myself to, Vue.JS and ReactJS as JS Frameworks.

## About me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Custom Web Components with StencilJS and LitElement.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer TypeScript, but work mainly in plain old JavaScript
