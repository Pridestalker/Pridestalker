### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitch Hijlkema and I'm a Web Developer. I prefer to work with PHP frameworks like WordPress and Laravel. And do not shy away from creating Front-End solutions using modern tooling. Including, but not limiting myself to, Vue.JS and ReactJS as JS Frameworks.

#### About me

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP, WordPress or Laravel
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Custom Web Components with StencilJS and LitElement.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I prefer TypeScript, but work mainly in plain old JavaScript
