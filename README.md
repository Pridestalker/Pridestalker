# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mitch 

So, I'm Mitch Hijlkema and I'm a Front-end Software Engineer. I work with modern Angular and TypeScript professionally, and am experienced using the PHP Framework Laravel and CMS WordPress.

Besides Angular I know my way around JavaScript Frameworks and Custom Web Components. By utilizing the best tool for the job I aim to deliver quick and reliable solutions.

At the moment I work at HillebrandGori (a DHL company). Here my focus is on external tooling for end customers in global alcohol freight where we function as a forwarder and internal tooling for our global users.

Besides this I dabble in Shopify consultancy to create storefront extensions using custom shopify apps for both basic and plus stores. To make this easier I'm working on a set of Web Components that offer a general framework using web native features named Zet.
